# react-mongodb-nodejs-express-fullstack-rest-app

# This app is useful for those who are curious to develop full stack app using modern NodeJs, React , Express and MongoDB database(NosQL).
# what you will learn here is:

-Develping Restful API using different HTTP endpoint using NodeJs , Mongoose, Express and Mongodb(NoSQL) cloud database as backend.
-Consuming REST API services  using React as frontend.
You should have basic understanding of ES6, MongoDB(Which is document based NoSQL database), EXpress(to handle routing), and of course,  React(basic understanding of -
functional based component and Class based component).
All the CSS are imported from Bootstrap.
# For security reasons the MongoDB database username and password has not been set to .env. Create your own mongodb database in mongodb atlas(Cloud), 
# reset your own username, password and databse name in .env file.


# The following command has been used to import NPM moudles on Server(backend)  and client(frontend):

# Server side(backend) :

npm init -y
npm install express cors mongoose dotenv
npm install -g nodemon
nodemon server               (run server.s) if any issue then run powershell as an administrator and use commands: (Get-ExecutionPolicy,  Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted) 

# Client side(frontend) :
